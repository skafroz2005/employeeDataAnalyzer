# üë®‚Äçüíª Employee Data Analyzer

## üöÄ Overview

The **Employee Data Analyzer** is a robust backend application built in Java, designed to process, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from employee datasets. It serves as the core logic for a system that can handle large volumes of employee information, perform complex calculations, and generate analytical reports.

*(**Note:** This is the backend component. The user's saved information indicates they are building the frontend using **React**.)*

## ‚ú® Features

This application is designed to handle common data analysis tasks for employee management:

* **Data Ingestion:** Reads employee data from various sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, or a database).
* **Data Filtering & Sorting:** Allows for filtering employees based on criteria (e.g., department, role, status) and sorting by metrics (e.g., salary, hire date).
* **Key Metrics Calculation:** Calculates important organizational metrics such as:
    * Average salary per department.
    * Headcount by location/team.
    * Tenure distribution.
* **Reporting:** Outputs analysis results to the console or prepares data for consumption by a frontend application.
